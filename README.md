# DroidVim

DroidVim is a Vim clone for Android.  
[Download the DroidVim from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droidvim)

To build the "DroidVim" application, choose the `droidvim` flavor and build.  
To avoid repository bloat, the latest Vim binaries are included in the `build` branch. If you need the latest Vim binaries, please checkout to the `build` branch before building.  
The `build` branch will be rebased to the `master` branch.  

This code is based on the "[Terminal Emulator for Android](https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator)".  
By choosing the `terminal` flavor, you can build the "Terminal Emulator for Android" compatible application with various functions of the DroidVim.
